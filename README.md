Presently works as an iOS Engineer at CELEBe Korea Co., Ltd. and as a Research Associate at the School of Computer Science and Engineering, International University (VNU-HCMC). I conduct research in the fields of computer vision, computer graphics, augmented reality, applied artificial intelligence and on-device machine learning utilizing mobile applications and other Apple-oriented platforms. Beside the coding work, I am also a proactive graphic, branding, and motion designer.
